1) Weakness: The menu isn't responsive for mobile or other devices.
D-Spot should make an online menu or the menu is not categorized enough to go to a particular item or category. For example, on Uber Eats app, you can go to different categories and scroll through different items. However, on D-Spots website, it's just an image of the menu so it's hard to navigate on other devices.
