# D-Spot Website Analysis

### Weakness: 
The menu isn't responsive for mobile or other devices.
D-Spot should make an online menu or the menu is not categorized enough to go to a particular item or category. For example, on Uber Eats app, you can go to different categories and scroll through different items. However, on D-Spots website, it's just an image of the menu so it's hard to navigate on other devices. 

Lack of immediate menu visibility can be frustrating for potential customers who want to quickly browse the offerings before deciding to place an order. The absence of a prominently displayed menu may lead to decreased user engagement and potentially lost business opportunities. The site's structure, which includes a long list of navigation items without clear organization, could overwhelm visitors and make it difficult for them to find essential information such as the menu.


### Technologies
Database management system: MySQL or MongoDB for storing menu items, customer information, and order details.

Content Management System (CMS): WordPress or a headless CMS like Contentful for easy menu updates and content management
